# EDA-of-World-Development-Indicators
I have done some **Exploratory Data Analysis** on the dataset mentioned below.
## Dataset
The dataset has been downloaded from [World Developmet indicators(2008-2015)](https://www.kaggle.com/malav9009/world-developmet-indicators20082015)
### Important
The jupyter notebook file is big so there is a slight chance that Github will not be able to load it properly.
In that case you can copy the jupyter notebook link of the notebook and paste it in the below mentioned address.
